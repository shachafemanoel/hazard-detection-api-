> Backend — 
  Diff-Aware Review &
   Async Blocking 
  Audit
  You are Claude 
  Code. I will attach
   the backend API 
  repo (FastAPI). 
  Perform a 
  diff-aware review 
  of recent changes 
  and hunt for bugs 
  and regressions.

  Scope (paths)
  detection.py, 
  external_apis.py, 
  reports.py, 
  sessions.py, 
  health.py

  session_service.py,
   report_service.py,
   performance_monito
  r.py

  app init / 
  __init__.py, plus 
  tests and 
  Dockerfile if 
  present

  Do
  Static audit (async
   correctness)

  Flag any 
  time.sleep(, 
  requests. inside 
  async def, blocking
   disk/CPU inside 
  handlers.

  Verify Cloudinary 
  calls run via await
   asyncio.to_thread(
  ...) or async 
  client.

  Find except: and 
  except Exception: 
  without logging or 
  re-raise. Replace 
  with narrow 
  handling and 
  logger.exception.

  Ensure no print( in
   library code. 
  Logging only.

  Config & health

  Confirm 
  pydantic-settings 
  usage and fail fast
   on missing 
  required envs.

  /health must 
  return: 
  {"status":"healthy"
  ,"model_status":"re
  ady|warming|error",
  "version":"..."}. 
  Add if missing.

  Contracts & 
  validation

  Ensure Pydantic 
  models for 
  request/response in
   reports.py and 
  sessions.py. 
  Validate inputs, 
  return consistent 
  errors.

  Deliver

  One Markdown report
   BACKEND_REVIEW.md 
  listing issues by 
  file+line with 
  suggested fixes.

  Minimal patch 
  (diff) applying the
   fixes, with tests 
  if needed.

  Run:

  ruff check ., black
   --check ., mypy .

  pytest -q

  If failures occur, 
  fix and re-run 
  until green.

⏺ I'll perform a
  comprehensive
  diff-aware review
  of the backend API
  repo focusing on
  async correctness,
  error handling, and
   configuration
  issues. Let me
  start by creating a
   todo list and then
   examining the
  recent changes.

> Backend — Test 
  Suite Scaffolding &
   Runtime Checks
  You are Claude 
  Code. In the 
  backend repo, 
  create a minimal 
  but meaningful test
   suite and run it.

  Tests to add
  tests/test_health.p
  y: 200 OK and 
  model_status 
  present.

  tests/test_detect.p
  y: mock model 
  inference to return
   a fixed structure;
   test success and 
  timeout path.

  tests/test_reports.
  py: happy path + 
  invalid payload 
  returns 422/400 
  with consistent 
  error JSON.

  tests/test_sessions
  .py: 
  start/end/summary 
  flows.

  Infra
  Use 
  httpx.AsyncClient 
  with the FastAPI 
  app.

  Add fixtures for 
  app and settings; 
  avoid hitting 
  external services 
  (mock 
  Cloudinary/Redis).

  Ensure 
  pyproject.toml 
  includes 
  ruff/black/mypy; 
  add a pre-commit 
  config if missing.

  Deliver
  Tests, passing 
  locally (pytest 
  -q).

  A short 
  TEST_NOTES.md with 
  how to run, plus 
  any flakiness 
  found.

  Backend — Docker & 
  CI Sanity
  You are Claude 
  Code. Verify 
  container and CI.

  Do
  Dockerfile: pinned 
  base, non-root, 
  install from pinned
   requirements.txt, 
  HEALTHCHECK hitting
   /health, set 
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTE
  CODE=1 and 
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1.

  Add/update GitHub 
  Actions ci.yml: 
  install → ruff → 
  black → mypy → 
  pytest.

  Produce 
  DOCKER_NOTES.md 
  with build and run 
  commands.
