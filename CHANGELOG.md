## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-09

### ðŸš€ Major Improvements

#### Added
- **Modern Development Tooling**
  - Added `ruff` for fast linting and formatting
  - Added `mypy` for static type checking
  - Added `pre-commit` hooks for code quality enforcement
  - Added `Makefile` with common development commands
  - Added comprehensive `pyproject.toml` configuration

- **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use new tooling
  - Improved Docker build process with multi-stage builds
  - Added security scanning and performance testing
  - Added automated deployment workflows

- **Production-Ready Docker Configuration**
  - Enhanced Dockerfile with security best practices
  - Added non-root user and proper permissions
  - Optimized layer caching and build process
  - Added health checks and environment configuration

- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Updated README.md with modern development workflow
  - Added detailed `.env.example` configuration
  - Created comprehensive improvement plan
  - Added Makefile commands documentation

#### Fixed
- **Critical Async Issues**
  - Fixed blocking `time.sleep()` in async context (app/services/cloudinary_service.py:139)
  - Replaced with proper `asyncio.sleep()` to prevent event loop blocking
  - This significantly improves API performance under load

- **Logging Improvements** 
  - Replaced `print()` statements with proper structured logging in main.py
  - Ensures consistent logging format across the application

#### Changed
- **Dependency Management**
  - Pinned all dependencies to exact versions for reproducible builds
  - Separated development dependencies into `dev-requirements.txt`
  - Updated Docker base image to specific Python 3.11.9 version

- **Docker Optimization**
  - Switched to uvicorn command in Dockerfile for better production control
  - Improved environment variable configuration
  - Enhanced security with proper file permissions

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

#### Breaking Changes
- None - All changes maintain API compatibility

#### Performance Improvements
- Fixed event loop blocking in Cloudinary upload retries
- Optimized Docker image build process
- Improved dependency resolution with pinned versions

#### Security Enhancements
- Non-root user in Docker container
- Proper file permissions in container
- No hardcoded secrets in configuration

#### Developer Experience
- One-command setup with `make dev-install`
- Consistent code formatting with ruff
- Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- Comprehensive testing with `make test`

### ðŸ“‹ Migration Guide

For existing deployments:

1. **No code changes required** - all improvements are backward compatible
2. **Update environment setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install new development tools (optional)
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   
   # Setup pre-commit hooks (optional)
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **For Docker deployments** - rebuild image to get latest optimizations:
   ```bash
   docker build -t hazard-detection-api:latest .
   ```

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

All improvements have been verified to meet production requirements:

- âœ… Server starts cleanly with single log line confirming model readiness
- âœ… `/health` returns 200 with app version and model status  
- âœ… Detection route is fully non-blocking end-to-end
- âœ… Docker image builds and runs successfully
- âœ… All existing tests continue to pass
- âœ… Code passes linting and type checking
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks prevent code quality regressions

### ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

Recommended follow-up improvements:
- Add more comprehensive integration tests
- Implement request rate limiting
- Add metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Enhance error monitoring and alerting
