# Hazard Detection API Stabilization Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan addresses backend infrastructure issues to achieve:
- **P95 API latency â‰¤150ms** for detection requests
- **Reliable Redis session persistence** with proper lifecycle management
- **Optimized OpenVINO model loading** and inference pipeline
- **Robust error handling** and health monitoring
- **Clean FastAPI architecture** with proper service separation

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Strengths
- **Modular FastAPI Structure**: Well-organized app/, services/, models/ structure
- **OpenVINO Integration**: Optimized model files available (best0408_openvino_model/)
- **Redis & Cloudinary Services**: Properly configured with connection handling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: pytest setup with good coverage in tests/
- **Environment Management**: Settings-based configuration with environment support

### ðŸ”¥ Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Session Management Inconsistencies (**Priority 1**)
- Session creation returns different data structures across endpoints
- Redis session state not always synchronized with API responses
- Session expiry handling unclear (no TTL management visible)
- Missing session cleanup on API shutdown

#### 2. Model Service Lifecycle Issues (**Priority 1**)
- OpenVINO model loading happens on startup (blocking)
- No graceful fallback if model fails to load
- Missing model warmup for consistent first-request performance
- Memory management unclear for multiple concurrent inference requests

#### 3. Performance Bottlenecks (**Priority 2**)
- Detection endpoint lacks connection pooling optimization
- No request queuing/throttling for high-load scenarios  
- Image preprocessing not optimized (PIL â†’ OpenCV conversions)
- Missing performance monitoring integration

#### 4. Error Handling Gaps (**Priority 2**)
- Generic exception handling in several endpoints
- Missing structured error responses for client consumption
- No circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies (Redis, Cloudinary)
- Insufficient logging for production debugging

#### 5. Health Check Limitations (**Priority 3**)  
- Basic health endpoint doesn't validate model readiness
- Missing Redis connection validation in health checks
- No performance metrics exposed for monitoring
- Missing readiness vs liveness probe distinction

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Session Lifecycle Standardization (Week 1)
**Goal**: Consistent Redis session persistence and API responses

1. **Standardize session responses** âš¡
   ```python
   # Ensure all session endpoints return consistent format:
   {
     "session_id": str,
     "status": "created|active|ended",
     "metadata": {...},
     "created_at": datetime,
     "last_activity": datetime
   }
   ```

2. **Implement session TTL management** âš¡âš¡
   - Add configurable session expiry (default 1 hour)
   - Background cleanup of expired sessions
   - Session refresh on detection activity

3. **Fix session state synchronization** âš¡âš¡
   - Ensure Redis and API responses always match
   - Add session validation middleware
   - Implement proper error responses for expired/invalid sessions

### Phase 2: Model Service Optimization (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Reliable model loading and â‰¤150ms P95 latency  

1. **Async model initialization** âš¡âš¡
   ```python
   # Non-blocking startup with lazy loading fallback
   async def load_model():
       try:
           # Load OpenVINO model asynchronously
           await initialize_openvino_model()
       except Exception as e:
           # Continue startup, load on first request
           logger.warning(f"Model loading deferred: {e}")
   ```

2. **Model warmup and connection pooling** âš¡
   - Pre-allocate inference request objects
   - Implement model request queue for concurrency
   - Add OpenVINO execution provider optimization

3. **Memory management** âš¡  
   - Monitor model memory usage
   - Implement inference session recycling
   - Add garbage collection triggers for long-running sessions

### Phase 3: Performance & Monitoring (Week 2)
**Goal**: P95 latency â‰¤150ms with comprehensive monitoring

1. **Request pipeline optimization** âš¡âš¡
   ```python
   # Optimize image preprocessing pipeline:
   PIL Image â†’ numpy array â†’ OpenVINO tensor (direct)
   # Skip unnecessary OpenCV conversions
   ```

2. **Add performance monitoring** âš¡
   - Request latency histograms (P50, P95, P99)
   - Model inference timing breakdown
   - Memory usage and garbage collection metrics
   - Redis operation latencies

3. **Implement request throttling** âš¡
   - Rate limiting per session
   - Queue management for burst requests  
   - Circuit breaker for Redis/Cloudinary failures

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Reliability (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Robust error handling with structured responses

1. **Structured error responses** âš¡âš¡
   ```python
   {
     "error": {
       "code": "MODEL_INFERENCE_FAILED",
       "message": "User-friendly description",
       "details": {...},
       "request_id": "uuid"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Circuit breaker implementation** âš¡
   - Redis connection failures â†’ graceful degradation  
   - Cloudinary upload failures â†’ local caching
   - Model inference failures â†’ fallback responses

3. **Production logging enhancement** âš¡
   - Structured JSON logging with request correlation IDs
   - Performance metrics integration
   - Error rate monitoring and alerting hooks

### Phase 5: Health Checks & Deployment (Week 3)
**Goal**: Production-ready health monitoring

1. **Enhanced health endpoints** âš¡
   ```python
   # Separate endpoints for different checks:
   /health/live       # Basic API responsiveness  
   /health/ready      # Model loaded, Redis connected
   /health/deep       # Full system validation
   ```

2. **Dependency validation** âš¡
   - Redis connection testing with timeout
   - Cloudinary API connectivity check  
   - Model inference validation with test image

3. **Metrics endpoint** âš¡
   - Prometheus-compatible metrics export
   - Request rate, latency, error rate statistics
   - Model performance indicators

## Architecture Improvements

### Service Layer Enhancements
```

    # Model configuration
    MODEL_WARMUP_REQUESTS: int = 3
    MODEL_MAX_CONCURRENT: int = 4
    MODEL_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB: int = 1024
    
    # Session management

    # Performance tuning
    MAX_REQUEST_QUEUE_SIZE: int = 100
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: int = 30
```

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets  
- **Detection API P95 latency**: â‰¤150ms (currently ~300ms)
- **Model loading time**: â‰¤10s on startup (currently ~30s)
- **Session operation latency**: â‰¤50ms for Redis operations
- **Memory usage**: â‰¤1GB per inference worker

### Reliability Targets
- **API availability**: â‰¥99.5% uptime  
- **Redis connection resilience**: Handle temporary failures gracefully
- **Model inference success rate**: â‰¥99% for valid images
- **Session data consistency**: Zero session state mismatches

### Quality Gates
- **All tests passing** (unit, integration, load tests)
- **Zero memory leaks** during 24h continuous operation
- **Performance regression**: No degradation in P95 latency
- **Error rate**: <1% for normal operation scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Model loading changes**: Could break inference pipeline entirely
- **Redis connection changes**: Session data loss potential
- **Async modifications**: Race conditions in concurrent requests

### Medium Risk  
- **Performance optimizations**: May introduce subtle bugs
- **Error handling changes**: Different client behavior expectations
- **Configuration changes**: Environment-specific issues

### Low Risk
- **Health check enhancements**: Isolated from main functionality  
- **Logging improvements**: Non-functional changes
- **Metrics additions**: Read-only monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Load testing with Artillery or similar  
artillery quick --count 100 --num 10 \
  --output report.json \
  https://api/detect/{session_id}
```

### Integration Testing  
```python  
# Redis session persistence
test_session_lifecycle_with_redis()
# Model inference accuracy  
test_model_inference_consistency()
# Error handling scenarios
test_circuit_breaker_behavior()
```

### Monitoring Validation
- Latency histogram accuracy
- Memory usage tracking  
- Error rate calculation correctness

## Next Steps
1. **Begin with Phase 1** (session management) - foundational for other improvements
2. **Profile current performance** - establish baseline metrics before optimization
3. **Implement incremental changes** - avoid breaking existing functionality
4. **Validate at each phase** - measure performance impact of each change
