# Railway Health Check Failure - Fixes Applied

## Issue Analysis
The service is failing health checks but the build completed successfully. This suggests:
1. App may be crashing on startup
2. App may be taking too long to start (model loading)
3. Import errors or dependency issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Extended Health Check Timeouts
```dockerfile
# Was: --start-period=120s
# Now: --start-period=300s (5 minutes for model loading)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=300s --retries=5
```

### 2. Added Startup Debug Script (`startup.sh`)
- Tests all critical imports before starting
- Checks model file existence
- Shows environment variables
- Better error reporting

### 3. Resilient Health Endpoint
- Won't fail if model service has issues
- Graceful degradation instead of crashes
- Returns "degraded" status instead of error

### 4. Added Debug Endpoint (`/debug`)
- Shows environment variables
- Lists model files found
- Python version info
- Directory contents

## Testing Strategy

After deployment, check these endpoints in order:

1. **Basic connectivity**: `GET /` - Should work even if models fail
2. **Debug info**: `GET /debug` - Shows environment and file system
3. **Health status**: `GET /health` - May show "degraded" but should respond
4. **Service logs**: Check Railway logs for detailed startup info

## Expected Startup Flow

```bash
üöÄ Starting Hazard Detection API...
üîç Python version: 3.11.x
‚úÖ FastAPI OK
‚úÖ OpenVINO OK  
‚úÖ aioredis OK
‚ö†Ô∏è Model files: /app/best0408_openvino_model/best0408.xml
üöÄ Starting uvicorn server...
INFO: Started server process [1]
INFO: Application startup complete
```

## If Still Failing

1. **Check Railway logs** for startup errors:
   ```bash
   railway logs --tail
   ```

2. **Test debug endpoint** once service starts:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/debug
   ```

3. **Common issues to look for**:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Import errors (dependency issues)  
   - Model files not copied to container
   - OpenVINO installation problems

## Expected Result

- Health checks should pass after 5 minutes
- Service should be accessible at `/health` and `/debug`
- Model loading may fail but app should still start
- Logs should show detailed startup diagnostics

Deploy and monitor the startup logs - you should see much more detailed information about what's happening during initialization.
