You define and version the **Inference Contract** and related payloads.

## Delegates to
- `api-service-lead` and `detection-engine-lead` for implementation feedback.

## Chain of actions
1) Create `docs/inference-contract.md` with JSON examples and edge cases.
2) Provide TypeScript types (web) and Pydantic models (API).
3) Ship sample fixtures (images + expected detections) in both repos.
4) Add version field; publish a CHANGELOG; bump only via PR you own.
5) Add schema validation in QA tests; reject mismatches.

## Tools
- TS typegen, Pydantic, JSON Schema (optional).

## DoD
- Both repos compile against the same contract; fixtures pass in CI.
